## Circuit Assembly, Modules & Connectivity

---

## Overview

This guide describes **how to assemble circuits using `tscircuit`** by:

* instantiating existing components
* organizing them into modules
* arranging schematic and PCB layouts
* defining connectivity using nets and traces

It assumes that **all components referenced already exist** and are importable.

---

## 1. Circuit Structure

### Root Container

Every circuit must be wrapped in a `<board />` element.

```tsx
<board width="100mm" height="80mm" routingDisabled={true}>
  {/* circuit contents */}
</board>
```

* `<board />` is the root of schematic and PCB generation
* All components, nets, groups, and traces must be children of `<board />`
* NOTE: Always use `routingDisabled={true}` property. We disable auto-routing to speed up evaluation.
---

## 2. Using Existing Components

### A. Built-in Primitives

`tscircuit` provides globally available primitives that **do not require imports**.

Common built-in primitives:

#### 1. `<resistor />`

* Pin details 

| Pin # | Aliases | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pin1 | left, pos | The left side pin in normal orientation |
| pin2 | right, neg | The right side pin in normal orientation |

* Mandatory Properties

- name
- resistance
- footprint

* Example 

```ts
export default () => (
<board width="10mm" height="10mm">  
    <resistor    
        name="R1"    
        footprint="0402"    
        resistance="1k"  
    />
</board>)
```


#### 2. `<capacitor />`

* Pin details 

| Pin # | Aliases (Polarized) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pin1 | pos, anode, left | The positive terminal (required for polarized capacitors) |

        footprint="axial_p5mm"

---

### B. Imported Components

Components defined elsewhere (e.g., ICs or reusable blocks) may be imported and instantiated.

```tsx
import { ControllerIC } from "./lib/imports/ControllerIC"

<ControllerIC name="U1" />
```

* Imported components are treated as black boxes
* Pin names must be used exactly as exposed by the component

---

## 3. Nets

### Declaring Nets

Named nets are used for shared electrical nodes.

```tsx
<net name="VCC" />
<net name="GND" />
```

* Nets should be declared near the top of the `<board />`
* Nets may be referenced anywhere within the board
* Net name should never start with a number ('<net name="12V"/> will result error)
* Never use period(.) in net name (`<net name="V3.3"/> will result in error)
---

### Connecting to Nets

Pins may be connected directly to nets.

```tsx
<trace from=".U1 > .VDD" to="net.VCC" />
<trace from=".U1 > .GND" to="net.GND" />
```
NOTE: Pins of a component are addressed in the specific pattern ".<component_name> .<pin_name>". Make sure you follow this syntax
---

## 4. Connectivity

### A. Point-to-Point Traces

Use `<trace />` to connect two pins.

```tsx
<trace from=".U1 > .TX" to=".R1 > .pin1" />
```

* `from` and `to` use CSS-like selectors
* Pin identifiers depend on the component definition

---

### B. Mixed Connectivity

Both nets and direct traces may coexist.

```tsx
<trace from=".C1 > .pin1" to="net.VCC" />
<trace from=".C1 > .pin2" to="net.GND" />
```

---

## 5. Modular Organization with `<group />`

### Purpose

`<group />` is a container for organizing related components and traces.

It may be used to:

* cluster functionally related elements
* simplify layout
* move multiple elements together

---

### Auto-Layout Support

`<group />` supports automatic layout for schematic and PCB.

#### Schematic Layout Props

* `schFlex`
* `schFlexDirection="row" | "column"`
* `schGap`

#### PCB Layout Props

* `pcbGrid`
* `pcbGridCols`
* `pcbGridGap`

---

### Example: Power Input Block

```tsx
<group
  schFlex
  schFlexDirection="row"
  schGap="2mm"
  pcbGrid
  pcbGridCols={2}
  pcbGridGap="1mm"
>
  <resistor name="R_Fuse" resistance="10" footprint="0603" />
  <capacitor name="C_Bulk" capacitance="100uF" footprint="1206" />

  <trace from=".R_Fuse > .pin2" to=".C_Bulk > .pos" />
</group>
```

---

## 6. Placement

### Manual Placement

Components or groups may be positioned explicitly.

* Schematic: `schX`, `schY`
* PCB: `pcbX`, `pcbY`

```tsx
<capacitor
  name="C1"
  capacitance="100nF"
  footprint="0402"
  schX={10}
  schY={5}
  pcbX={12}
  pcbY={8}
/>
```

---

### Placement Strategy

* Manual coordinates are typically used at **top-level**
* Auto-layout is preferred inside dense groups

---

## 7. Canonical Assembly Example

```tsx
import { ControllerIC } from "/app/lib/ControllerIC"

export default () => {
  return (
    <board width="100mm" height="80mm">
      <net name="VCC" />
      <net name="GND" />

      <ControllerIC name="U1" />

      <capacitor
        name="C_Decouple"
        capacitance="100nF"
        footprint="0402"
      />

      <trace from=".U1 > .VDD" to="net.VCC" />
      <trace from=".U1 > .GND" to="net.GND" />
      <trace from=".C_Decouple > .pin1" to="net.VCC" />
      <trace from=".C_Decouple > .pin2" to="net.GND" />
    </board>
  )
}
```

## 9. Importing Local Library Components

This section describes **how to import existing local component libraries** into a `tscircuit` circuit file.
These components are **already defined** as `.tsx` modules and reside in the project’s local library directory.

> You **must never redefine components**.
> If a component exists in the local library, it **must be imported and instantiated**, not recreated.

---

### Library Location Convention

All locally available component libraries are stored under:

```text
./lib/imports/
```

Each component is defined in its own `.tsx` file and exposes **exactly one exported component**.

---

### Import Syntax

Use standard TypeScript import syntax with a **absolute path**:

```ts
import { LM555 } from "./lib/imports/LM555"
```

Multiple components may be imported as needed:

```ts
import { LM555 } from "./lib/imports/LM555"
import { IR2110 } from "./lib/imports/IR2110"
import { IRFZ44N } from "./lib/imports/IRFZ44N"
```

---

### Instantiating Imported Components

Once imported, components are instantiated like any other `tscircuit` element.

Example:

```tsx
<LM555 name="U1" />
<IR2110 name="U2" />
<IRFZ44N name="Q1" />
```

**Rules:**

* The `name` prop is mandatory
* Imported components are treated as **black boxes**
* Internal pin mappings must not be inferred or modified

---

### Interaction with Built-in Primitives

Imported components may coexist with built-in primitives:

```tsx
<resistor name="R1" resistance="10k" footprint="0603" />
<BZX84C24 name="D1" />
```
